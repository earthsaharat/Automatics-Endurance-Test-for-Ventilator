# Automatics-Endurance-Test-for-Ventilator

Due to the epidemic of COVID-19, ventilators are insufficient in hospitals for the patients. Our university has invented a mini ventilator. To make enough for the number of patients But the ventilator needs to be tested and verified before use.

So I created an automatics endurance test for the ventilator to test pulse and changed volume by using knowledge of computer vision and Python programming. All of this program must be run automatically because results must be a record for longtime-test.
